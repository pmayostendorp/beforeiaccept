# beforeIAgree
Insight Data Science 2017 Remote Program project developing tools for automagically analyzing privacy policy content.

## Motivation

Consumers sign billions of pages of legal contracts every year with a few simple clicks without reading or understanding the contents of those contracts. Website and web service privacy policies are generally opaque to the public. beforeIAgree uses natural language processing and machine learning to digest privacy policies for consumers.

## Acknowledgments

beforeIAgree is trained on the OPP-115 corpus from UsablePrivacy.org. Please see the paper listed below for details on the development and content of the dataset.

Some are died-in-the-wool barbecue buffs, but most are aficionados of Lenny\u2019s unerring gift for creating purely delicious, unique dishes and serving them in a purely fun place where guests linger for hours.</p>\n\n<p>There have been a few surprises along the way for owner Lenny Bent, a celebrity chef well-known to Angelenos through his own blues cooking show (he\u2019s also a blues musician) and frequent appearances on KTLA Morning News and Good Day L.A. For decades he catered to working crews in \u201cthe industry\u201d and became coveted for his always-tasty, fabulously creative meals. He opened the Smokehouse last summer so he could have a fixed location for serving the dishes that his catering customers loved best, and also to indulge his passion for smoke-infused foods and barbecue ranging from relatively straight-ahead pulled pork and smoked ribs, to whiskey-glazed masterpieces that have made Bent a bit of a Southland legend.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI was a little surprised that the Smokehouse has become a place where people just love to spend time,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cThey love the smell of the wood barbecue and they love the ambience. They\u2019ll stay here and enjoy themselves for hours on end.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Certainly they also love the food, which is uniquely and originally Bent\u2019s in every way, made from scratch via recipes that are Bent\u2019s creations alone. For a good example, look at the recipe for Smoked Maple Chicken with Whiskey and Rosemary (included in these pages).</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThat one gives a little insight on what all our recipes are like,\u201d Bent says. \u201cIt\u2019s different from traditional approaches, but of real quality with complex flavors.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Bent put as original a touch on his dining room policy: all of the wait staff are professional entertainers, and when they have a minute, step up to the stage to sing a ballad or pop tune, sometimes to the accompaniment of Bent on guitar. From origins to food to ambience, the Smokehouse is as quintessentially \u201cL.A.\u201d as it gets \u2013 the kind of place that could only happen in Southern California.</p>\n\n<p>Cookin\u2019 with Lenny\u2019s Smokehouse is at 23360 Lake Manor Drive in Chatsworth. On weekends, reservations are highly recommended.

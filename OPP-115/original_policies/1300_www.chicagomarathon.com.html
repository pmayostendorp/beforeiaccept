<p>Opting out also means that the online content and advertising you receive on our non-servicing sites (i.e. before sign-in) will be untailored and will not be based on your online behavior or your relationship.</p>
<p>Please note that if you opt out of this advertising, you may still receive untailored advertising from Bank of America.&nbsp; When accessing online account servicing areas (i.e. after sign-in), such as Online Banking or MyMerrill, you may receive tailored content and advertising based on your account relationships.&nbsp; In addition, financial advisors/Client Managers may continue to use information collected online as described in this Notice to provide details on products and services in accordance with account agreements. See <strong>Important Reminder</strong> section below.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bank managed Direct Marketing:</strong></span>&nbsp; If you prefer we not deliver you marketing offers in email, postal mail or through telemarketing you may manage your direct marketing <a href="https://secure.bankofamerica.com/customer/public/privacy.go" target="_self">choices online</a>&nbsp; or:</p>
<ul>

<li>through your assigned account representative (e.g., Financial Advisor, Mortgage Loan Officer) or a representative at a banking center</li>
</ul>
					<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Advertising on third party sites:</span></strong> Bank of America participates in the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) self-regulatory program,&nbsp;uses the&nbsp;<a class="com-interstitial-modal-link com-interstitial-modal-link-wired" rel="http://www.aboutads.info/" name="aboutads" href="javascript:void(0);"> Advertising Options Icon</a> on our behavioral ads on third party sites (excluding ads appearing on platforms that do not accept the icon) and adheres to the DAA self-regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.&nbsp;Anyone receiving a behavioral ad may click on the displayed icon to receive more information and can opt out at that time or by visiting the third party site's privacy policy for an opt out mechanism.</p>
					<p>You may also opt out of receiving behavioral ads from many sites through the <a class="com-interstitial-modal-link com-interstitial-modal-link-wired" rel="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices" name="NAI" href="javascript:void(0);">Network Advertising Initiative's Opt-Out Tool</a> or other tools provided by the publishing platform.</p>
					<p>Please note that if you opt out, you may still receive untailored online advertising from Bank of America. Opting out from a specific third party site means that the ads you receive will not be tailored based on your&nbsp;choices or behavior.</p>
						<h4 id="important-reminder">Important Reminder</h4>
					<p>In order for&nbsp;online behavioral advertising opt outs from our Sites and on&nbsp;other sites to work on your device, your browser must be set to accept cookies. If you delete cookies, buy a new device, access our Site or other sites from a different device, login under a different screen name, or change web browsers, you will need to opt-out again. If your browser has scripting disabled, you do not need to opt out, as&nbsp;online behavioral advertising technology does not work when scripting is disabled. Please check your browser's security settings to validate whether scripting is active or disabled.</p>
						<h4 class="h4">Mobile Applications</h4>
					<p>Bank of America's Mobile Applications for U.S. accounts ("Applications") allows you to access your account balances and holdings, make deposits, transfers and pay bills on your mobile device.&nbsp; This Notice applies to any Personal Information or Other Information that we may collect through the Applications.</p>
						<h4 class="h4">Linking to other sites</h4>
					<p>We may provide links to third party sites, such as credit bureaus, service providers or merchants. If you follow links to sites not affiliated or controlled by Bank of America, you should review their privacy and security policies and other terms and conditions, as they may be different from those of our Sites.

						<h4 class="h4">Using other aggregation websites</h4>
					<p>Other companies offer aggregation websites and services that allow you to consolidate your financial account information from different sources (such as your accounts with us or with other financial institutions) so that you can view all your account information at one online location. To do this, an aggregation provider may request access to Personal Information, such as financial information, usernames and passwords. You should use caution and ensure that the aggregator company has appropriate policies and practices to protect the privacy and security of any information you provide or to which they are gaining access. We are not responsible for the use or disclosure of any Personal Information accessed by any company or person to whom you provide your Site username and password.</p>
					<p>If you provide your Site username, password or other information about your accounts with us to an aggregation website, we will consider that you have authorized all transactions or actions initiated by an aggregation website using access information you provide, whether or not you were aware of a specific transaction or action.&nbsp; If you decide to revoke the authority you have given to an aggregation website, we strongly recommend that you change your password for the Site to ensure that the aggregation website cannot continue to access your account.</p>
						<h4 class="h4">Making sure information is accurate</h4>
					<p>Keeping your account information accurate and up to date is very important. If your account information is incomplete, inaccurate or not current, please use the Contact Us option on our Site, or call or write to us at the telephone numbers or appropriate address for changes listed on your account statements, records, online or other account materials. You can also speak to a customer representative at a banking center, your Financial Advisor or account representative.</p>

								<h3>Advertising Practices</h3>
									<p>We strive to provide you with information about products and services you might find interesting and useful. Relationship-based ads and online behavioral advertising help us do that.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: We gather information about your online activities, such as the searches you conduct on our Sites and the pages you visit. This information may be used to deliver advertising on our Sites and offline (for example, by phone, email and direct mail) that's customized to meet specific interests you may have.</p>
<p>If you prefer that we do not use this information, you may <a onclick="$(&#39;.ui-dialog&#39;).remove();" name="WebsiteAdPractices_OptOut" href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/privacy/online-privacy-notice.go#advertising-on-our-sites" target="_blank">opt out of online behavioral advertising</a>. If you opt out, though, you may still receive generic advertising. In addition, financial advisors/Client Managers may continue to use information collected online to provide product and service information in accordance with account agreements.</p>
<p>Also, if you opt out of online behavioral advertising, you may still see ads when you sign in to your account, for example through Online Banking or MyMerrill. These ads are based on your specific account relationships with us.</p>
<p>To learn more about relationship-based ads, online behavioral advertising and our privacy practices, please review the <a onclick="$(&#39;.ui-dialog&#39;).remove();" name="WebsiteAdPractices_PrivacyNotice" href="./1300_www.chicagomarathon.com_files/1300_www.chicagomarathon.com.html" target="_blank">Bank of America Online Privacy Notice</a> and our <a onclick="$(&#39;.ui-dialog&#39;).remove();" name="Online-privacy-faqs" href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/privacy/faq/online-privacy-faq.go" target="_blank">Online Privacy FAQs</a>.</p>

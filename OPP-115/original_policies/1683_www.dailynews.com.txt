MediaNews may also collect information such as household income, job title, personal interests and hobbies. The PIN collected depends on the page you are visiting and the services that you participate in.
Web Site User Registration: User registration is required to access the majority of content, services and features on MediaNews Web sites. Upon registration, we require you provide your email address or your first name as a username and a password that will allow you to change your PIN as needed. User registration with MediaNews Web sites is completed and membership activated upon clicking a link e-mailed to the address provided in registration. At that time you have the opportunity to opt-in to e-mail newsletters and alerts and have e-mail offers sent to you on behalf of MediaNews advertisers, however, you can update your preferences at a later time.
Web Site Sites & Products: Your PIN as well as a telephone number, credit card number or other billing information is generally collected in order to process the purchase of services or products on the MediaNews Web sites, such as purchasing a newspaper subscription or placing an ad. Your PIN will also be collected upon registration for home delivery requests, vacation delivery stop requests and other similar requests as well as upon the use or download of software available on MediaNews Web sites.
Sweepstakes, Contests, Promotions, Special Offers: MediaNews may request additional PIN from you upon your optional entry in any sweepstakes, contests, promotions or special offers found on MediaNews Web sites.
Feedback, Commentary, Surveys, Message Boards, Chat Rooms: Those Web site users that choose to provide feedback or commentary, fill out surveys, engage in MediaNews chat rooms or use MediaNews message boards may be required to provide additional PIN such as demographic information, household/personal characteristics and purchase behavior.
If such information is gathered for a MediaNews survey, no PIN is released and is reported or used only in aggregate form.
Some chat room and message board forums may require registration and the sharing of PIN. Any information disclosed in chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups becomes public information. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information in public forums.
Forwarding: Forwarding an article found on a MediaNews Web site generally requires that you disclose the name and e-mail address of the person to whom you are forwarding the article. MediaNews will retain this information only to provide the forwarding services.
Special Circumstances: MediaNews may disclose and use the information collected where required to do so by law, or where MediaNews, in good faith, believes the use or disclosure of the information collected is necessary to (1) comply with the law or legal processes; (2) protect and defend MediaNews rights and property; (3) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of any MediaNews Web site; or to (4) protect the personal safety or property of our users or the public.

Computer Identifying Information (CIN)
The information personal to your computer and your computer use that is automatically collected through the use of electronic tools is referred to as Computer Identifying Information (CIN).

CHILDREN'S PRIVACY POLICY
This policy describes the privacy practices of MediaNews Group, Inc. and MediaNews Group Interactive, Inc., as well as MediaNews Group affiliates (“MediaNews”) relating to information collected from children. This privacy policy does not apply to third party web sites, or to companies and persons that are not controlled by, affiliated with or managed by MediaNews. For most MediaNews Web sites, MediaNews does not knowingly collect information from children under 13 years of age. In the event that MediaNews collects information from children under 13 years of age, this Children's Privacy Policy shall apply.
INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM CHILDREN
MediaNews does not ask children to disclose more personal information than is necessary for them to participate in a particular activity. We urge children to check with their parents before entering information on any web site and we urge parents to discuss with their children restrictions regarding the online release of personal information. MediaNews limits its collection of information from children to what is known as non-personally identifiable information (e.g. first name, screen names, age, gender, city, state, zip code and country of residence). This information is collected so children can participate in activities (e.g. completing polls or online surveys, posting jokes, book reviews, movie reviews, toy reviews, video reviews, concert reviews, game reviews, artwork or questions/comments online, or playing online games) without giving unnecessary personal information. From time to time, however, we may request personally identifiable information (e.g. child's email address and/or parent's or guardian's email address), as explained below, in order to conduct online contests or sweepstakes, email newsletters and offers, provide subscriptions, participate in chat rooms and message boards, or offer other online activities. MediaNews does not and cannot condition a child's participation in any of our online activities on the disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. Information is collected actively, such as through registration forms, and passively, such as through cookies.
USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN
MediaNews occasionally offers contest and sweepstakes, which may be entered online. When a child under thirteen 13 enters a contest or sweepstakes, or participates in another activity that requires the use of personal information, we will ask for a parent's email address so that we can notify the parent of the child's participation, obtain the parent's consent and give the parent the option to have the child's information deleted. All of the child's personal information collected by MediaNews is securely maintained and used only for the specified purpose such as conducting the contest or sweepstakes and awarding prizes. MediaNews does not keep any of the child's personal information after the particular event is completed. Sometimes, MediaNews uses agents or contractors to provide services that support the internal operations of the site, such as helping us conduct a sweepstakes or sending prizes to winners. In these cases, MediaNews requires the agent or contractor to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of the information and limit use to the specific services they are performing on our behalf.
MediaNews may disclose information maintained as required by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. MediaNews may also disclose such information in response to a specific law enforcement agency's request. Personal information is not disclosed to third parties except those who provide support for the internal operations of the site. Parents can consent to the collection and use of their child's personal information without consenting to the disclosure of the information to third parties.
PARENTAL ACCESS
MediaNews Group and MediaNews Group affiliates are the operators collecting information at this web site. Please send an email or letter to our Privacy Coordinator at the email or mailing address provided below if you would like to do any of the following:
Access personally identifiable information that MediaNews has collected from your child,
Correct factual errors in such information,
Request to have this information deleted, or
Request that we no longer collect or maintain such information about your child.
Please include your email address and telephone number where we can reach you. MediaNews takes steps to verify the identity of anyone requesting information about a child to ensure that the person is in fact the child's parent or legal guardian.
MediaNews may change this privacy policy from time to time. The revised policy will be posted on the MediaNews Web site. Please check this page periodically for changes. If you have any questions, comments or concerns regarding our privacy policy and/or practices, please contact the Privacy Coordinator using the contact information provided below. Please reference the applicable site.

CLASSIFIED ADVERTISING
When you submit a classified ad for publication on MediaNews, you agree that the advertisement as it appears on MediaNews becomes the property of MediaNews and you assign all ownership interest in the advertisement as it appears on the Sites, under copyright law or otherwise, to MediaNews. Submission of an advertisement does not constitute a commitment to publish the advertisement, and publication of an advertisement does not constitute an agreement for continued publication. MediaNews reserves the right to edit, reclassify, revise, reject or cancel any advertisement at any time, in its sole discretion. Rates and specifications are subject to change.
REAL ESTATE ADVERTISEMENTS; EQUAL HOUSING OPPORTUNITY
All real estate advertised at the Sites is subject to the Federal Fair Housing Act, which makes it illegal to advertise "any preference, limitation, or discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin, or intention to make any such preference, limitation, or discrimination." State law may also forbid discrimination based on these factors and others. MediaNews will not knowingly accept any advertising for real estate that is in violation of the law. All persons are hereby informed that all dwellings advertised are available on an equal opportunity basis. To complain of discrimination call the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development at 800-669-9777.

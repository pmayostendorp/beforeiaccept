Use of Cookies

Sci-News.com uses “cookie” technology. A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer or mobile phone browser from a website’s computer and is stored on your device’s hard drive. A website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other websites. Many websites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to track online traffic flows.

During the course of any visit to the Sci-News.com website, the pages you see, along with a cookie, are downloaded to your device. A website does this because cookies enable a publisher to find out whether the device has visited the website before. This is done on a repeat visit by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit.

Please note that during or after your visits to the Sci-News.com website you may notice some cookies that are not related to it. Sci-News.com does not control the dissemination of these cookies. You must check the third party websites for more information about these.

You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of the site.

Disclosure of Your Information

Sci-News.com does not sell, trade or rent your personal information to third parties. If we choose to do so in the future, you will be notified by email of our intentions, and have the right to be removed prior to the disclosure.

Your Consent and Rights

By using Sci-News.com, you consent to the collection and use, in accordance with this policy, of the information you provide to us.

We will remove you and your personally identifiable information from our records on request if you contact us with your request at privacy@sci-news.com.

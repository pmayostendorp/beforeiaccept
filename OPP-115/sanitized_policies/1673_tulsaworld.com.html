When you access these pages or open or click an email, pixel tags and web beacons generate a non-personally identifiable notice of that action. Pixel tags allow us to measure and improve our understanding of visitor traffic and behavior on our Website, as well as give us a way to measure our promotions and performance. We may also utilize pixel tags and web beacons provided by our affiliates and/or marketing partners for the same purposes. <br> <br>|||From time to time, Tulsaworld.com will conduct surveys on its site for research purposes.

When you click on an advertisement, visit an advertiser's Web site or make a purchase from an advertiser, that company may use cookies according to their own policies. Advertisers' cookies are not covered under Tulsaworld.com's policy. In addition, we may use third party advertising companies to display advertisements on our Website. As part of their service, they may place separate cookies on your computer. We have no access to or control over these cookies. <br> <br>|||You do not have to permit the use of cookies. You can, through the options in your Web browser, choose to accept all cookies, choose to reject all cookies or choose to receive notification when a cookie is being delivered so that you can make a decision whether to accept each cookie on a case-by-case basis.

Please note that if you decline or delete these cookies, some parts of the Website may not work properly. <br> <br>|||General statistical information <br> <br> Visits to Tulsaworld.com are monitored to gather statistical information, including the number of visits to the site, the pages visited, which domains visitors come from and the browsers used to visit the site. This data is accumulated at the aggregate level. We may use third parties to gather, collect and report on this non-personally identifiable information. <br> <br>|||This statistical information enables us to evaluate the effectiveness of the services we provide, to monitor site performance and to make it easier for visitors to use the site. <br> <br>|||How does Tulsaworld.com use the information it gathers- <br> <br> Information collected on Tulsaworld.com, including traffic patterns and user behavior, is used primarily for the following purposes: <br> <br>|||Internal research. Tulsaworld.com is continuously assessing how visitors use the site. This data assists us in making decisions about how to improve the site and to better serve our users. Research data are aggregated and do not include data about specific individuals. We may share aggregated research (but not individual user information) with our advertisers or business partners. Additionally, Tulsaworld.com may use your information to contact you to ask for your participation in a focus group, survey, or some other type of research effort. <br> <br>|||To customize your experience on Tulsaworld.com. As Tulsaworld.com improves its service, it may offer users more opportunities to customize content and other aspects of the site. Information provided by you may be used to assist in the customization process, if you elect to participate in these features. <br> <br>|||To tailor advertising efforts. Most of the information and services available to you at Tulsaworld.com are free. In order to continue providing services free of charge, Tulsaworld.com sells advertising. Advertisers prefer to target their communication toward audiences who are most likely to be interested in their products. The information gathered on Tulsaworld.com helps us advise advertisers in general terms about certain aspects of site visitors (e.g. how visitors use the site, general demographic attributes of visitors, usage patterns on various parts of our site, etc.). This information helps both advertisers and Tulsaworld.com make better decisions about where to place advertising. This information may also be used to send targeted marketing, such as emails, to users that we think would be interested in such marketing. Visitors who choose to conduct financial transactions with advertisers on Tulsaworld.com may also provide specific data to those advertisers during the process of their transactions. Additionally, any information provided during the purchase of Tulsaworld.com or Tulsa World products or services will result in the collection of certain information required to complete the transaction. <br> <br>|||To use third party service providers. We provide some services and products through third parties. These third party service providers may perform functions on our behalf, like sending out and distributing promotional emails. We may share your personally identifiable information with such service providers as necessary to allow those service providers to fulfill orders, send mail or email, administer contests or sweepstakes, remove repetitive information on customer lists, analyze data, provide marketing assistance, provide search results and links, process credit card payments, operate the Website, troubleshoot, or provide customer service. We may also collect personal information from individuals and companies with whom we have business relationships ("Affiliates") and may share your information with service providers to accomplish our administrative tasks. For example, when you order a service, the third party payment processor we use releases your credit card information to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment for the service. The use of your personally identifiable information by these third parties is governed by the privacy policies of these third parties and is not subject to our control. <br> <br>|||More specifically, here is how Tulsaworld.com may use information you provide: <br> <br>|||E-mail addresses. If you supply Tulsaworld.com with your e-mail address, either by registering on the site, by communicating with us via e-mail, or signing up for promotional offers or emails, we may, from time to time, send you information that we believe would be of interest to you via e-mail. This information may be from Tulsaworld.com, the Tulsa World, or sent by us on behalf of one of our quality advertisers. Note: If we send you e-mail on behalf of another company, your personally identifiable information is not disclosed to that company unless you purchase a product or service from that company in which case it may need your information to fulfill your purchase. Rather, the company provides us with the information it wants to send, and we prepare and send the e-mail directly to you. We may use a third party service provider to manage or send emails on our behalf, but that third party is only authorized to use your information as necessary to send our email to you and it is not authorized to sell or transfer your information. <br> <br>|||Postal addresses. If you supply Tulsaworld.com with your postal address, we may send you periodic mailings with information on new products, coming events, surveys or other research materials, or other information we think might be of interest to you. <br> <br>|||Telephone numbers. If you provide your telephone number or cell phone number, Tulsaworld.com may call or text you regarding orders you have placed online, to tell you about new products, services, or coming events, or to offer other information that may interest you. Additionally, Tulsaworld.com, the Tulsa World or one of their agents may call you for research purposes. <br> <br>|||Sale transaction information. From time to time, we provide offers from our advertisers who, as part of their offer, request information on customers who purchased their offer in order to allow the advertiser to fulfill the purchase. In those cases, we share some of your personally identifiable information with that advertiser. Sharing this Information may allow that advertiser to market directly to you should it choose to do so. However, we will only share personally identifiable information with an advertiser if you provide us that information and enter into a transaction with that advertiser on or through our Website. We are not responsible or liable for the actions of such advertiser. <br> <br>|||Business transfer. We may also share your information in the case our business is sold or transferred. If this occurs, the successor company would acquire the information we maintain, including personally identifiable information. <br> <br>|||What information is covered by this privacy policy- What isn't- <br> <br> All information you provide directly to Tulsaworld.com is covered under this privacy policy.

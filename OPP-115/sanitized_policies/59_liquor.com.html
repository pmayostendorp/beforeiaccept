It is the goal of Liquor.com to bring you information that is relevant and targeted to your individual needs and, at the same time, protect your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we treat the information we collect when you visit our Web site and/or register for our email publication. Please read this notice carefully. <br> <br>|||PERSONAL INFORMATION <br> <br> In order to distribute our email publication, we need your e-mail address. So that we may provide you with additional services as well as more interesting and relevant content, we may request additional information, including your name, zip code and telephone number. Liquor.com does not collect any other personal information that you do not expressly provide. LIQUOR.COM WILL NOT DISCLOSE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO ANY THIRD PARTY WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT, EXCEPT TO A THIRD PARTY AS REQUIRED TO HELP US DISTRIBUTE OUR EMAIL PUBLICATION. <br> <br>|||NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION <br> <br> We may also request non-personally identifiable information, for example, annual income, buying preferences, and age. This information, also known as demographic and profile data, is optional. We may use this data to improve our site and/or personalize your experience at our site, in order to bring you more targeted and relevant content and to display such content according to your preferences. We may share this information with others, such as advertisers interested on advertising on the Liquor.com site but never on an individual level. This information will only be shared in an aggregate, anonymous form, which means that the information will not contain any personally identifiable information about you or any other person. However, we reserve the right to use aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a group for any business purpose, such as analyzing usage trends and seeking compatible advertisers and partners. <br> <br>|||USAGE INFORMATION <br> <br> In addition to collecting personal and non-personal information, Liquor.com may also collect non-personal, aggregated information about subscribers' use of our emails and our site. This information is not personally identifiable and will only be used to find out how subscribers use our service and site. For example, this information will tell us how much time users spend on our site, from which other sites subscribers came, and to what other sites subscribers go. The collection of this information allows us to, among other things, prepare for traffic load demands and to efficiently distribute our email publication. <br> <br>|||REVIEW AND ACCESS <br> <br> You will have the ability to access the information that we have collected about you. You will have an opportunity to correct, update or modify this information. <br> <br>|||CHOICE/OPT-OUT <br> <br> If we ever send you information by e-mail concerning new products or services that you did not expressly request, we will provide you with an e-mail address by which you may request no future notices. <br> <br>|||THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING <br> <br> Some of the ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to you by our web advertising partners. Information about your visit to their site, such as number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address or other personal information), is used to serve ads to you. <br> <br>|||TRACKING & THIRD PARTY COOKIES <br> <br> You may have read about "cookies" or bits of information that are placed by a Website in a storage place on your own computer.

We may, from time to time, use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, gather broad demographic information and administer our Website. <br> <br>|||PARENTAL DISCRETION <br> <br> Liquor.com is not intended for use by children, especially those under age 13.

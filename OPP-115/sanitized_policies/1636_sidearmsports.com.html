This Privacy Policy, effective December 9, 2014, describes the privacy practices for our Web Sites and other applications (collectively referred to as the "SIDEARM Services") and to any services that display this notice. <br> <br>|||Our Web Sites may contain links to other websites for your convenience and information. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those websites. <br> <br>|||INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU <br> <br> When you interact with SIDEARM Services, we collect: (1) personal information you supply when you subscribe, order, complete a form or survey, register for one of our Web Sites, enter a contest or provide your email address and (2) non-personal information transmitted through technology, including tracking information, which is also collected by third parties. <br> <br>|||<strong> Personal Information That You Supply </strong> <br> <br> Registration Information <br> <br> Registration for SIDEARM Services may require that you supply certain personal information, including a unique email address and demographic information (e.g., ZIP code, age, sex, household income, job industry and job title) to register. <br> <br>|||Billing and Credit Card Information <br> <br> To enable payment via the SIDEARM Services, we collect and store name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card information and other billing information. Excluding credit card information, this information may be shared with third parties or used for marketing purposes. Credit card information will only be shared with third parties who help to complete the purchase transaction (e.g., those who help fulfill orders and process credit card payments). <br> <br>|||User Generated Content and Public Activities (Including Comments) <br> <br> We offer you the opportunity to engage in public activities on our Web Sites and other SIDEARM Services. "Public activities" include any actions you take on our Web Sites that are designed to be visible to other users, including comments or any other items that you submit. Any information you disclose in your public activities, along with your screen name or ID, or any image or photo, becomes public and may be used by SIDEARM Sports for online and offline promotional or commercial uses in any and all media. If you choose to engage in public activities, you should be aware that any personal information you submit can be read, collected and used by other users.

We do not record those comments. For example, when you share content from our Web Sites on your Facebook profile, that action is governed by the Facebook Privacy Policy. <br> <br>|||We have engaged with a third party service called AddThis to provide us information, reports and analysis about users' engagement with our content.

If you do not enable the location-based service, or if an app does not have that feature, the app will not transmit to us, and we will not collect or store, location information. <br> <br>|||Ads may be displayed within our apps. The ads you see may be targeted to you based on your current GPS location, proximity of your device to an active beacon or low-energy blue-tooth transmitter, your device's IP address or ZIP code and user provided location information such as seat location.

These companies may place or recognize cookies, Web beacons or other technology to track certain non-personal information about our website users. For example, in the course of serving certain advertisements, an advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser in order to collect certain information about your use of the SIDEARM Services. In many cases, this information could be used to show you ads on other websites based on your interests. <br> <br>|||We do not have access to, nor control over, advertisers' or service providers' use of cookies or other tracking technologies or how they may be used. <br> <br>|||Your access to our Web Sites should not be affected if you do not accept cookies served by third parties. <br> <br>|||WHAT WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION WE'VE COLLECTED ABOUT YOU <br> <br> Provide the Services You Request <br> <br> We use the information we gather about you to enable your use of the SIDEARM Services, fulfill your requests for certain products and services, such as sending out electronic newsletters and enabling you to participate in and renew paid services, polls, contests, and message boards. <br> <br>|||Statistical Analysis <br> <br> We perform statistical, demographic and marketing analyses of users of the SIDEARM Services, and their subscribing and purchasing patterns, for product development purposes and to generally inform advertisers about the nature of our subscriber base.

Except for Kids Club Registrations or similar alternatives, including, but not limited to, camps, SIDEARM Sports does not knowingly collect or store any personal information about children under the age of 13. <br> <br>|||Kids Club Registrations or Similar Alternatives. Some of our partner schools offer children under the age of 13 the opportunity to join "kids clubs" or similar alternatives. Registration for these clubs requires that we obtain certain personal information about participants. We do not collect personally identifiable information on our Web Sites from children under the age of 13 without prior parental consent. We do not ask children to disclose more information than is necessary for them to participate in a particular activity, and we take steps to prevent children from disclosing more information than is necessary to participate in those activities. <br> <br>|||For children under the age of 13, parents will initially provide certain personal information about or for their child; we will not collect it from the child directly. If a child under age 13 then participates in any ongoing activity that requires the collection, retention, and use of personal information in addition to what has already been provided or authorized by the parent, we will also ask for a parent's e-mail address so that we can notify the parent that we have received personal information from their child and seek consent to retain this information. We do not knowingly collect names and e-mail addresses or other personally identifying information from children under age 13 for these types of activities without notifying the parent via e-mail and giving the parent the option to remove their child's e-mail address from the applicable database for that activity. <br> <br>|||These children's guidelines have been developed with the recognition that Internet technology evolves rapidly and that underlying business models are still not established. Accordingly, guidelines are subject to change. In the unlikely event of such changes they will be posted on this page. If the changes represent a material departure from our current practice with respect to the use of children's personal information, the changes will be posted on this page thirty (30) days prior to taking effect and will not affect children's personal information previously collected. <br> <br>|||Your California Privacy Rights <br> <br> Under the California "Shine The Light" law, California residents may opt-out of SIDEARM's disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. As detailed above, you may choose to opt-out of the sharing of your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes at any time by submitting a request in writing to SIDEARM Sports, 335 Hinds Hall, Syracuse NY 13244 or by emailing us at sidearm@sidearmsports.com. It is important to note that this opt-out does not prohibit disclosures made for non-marketing purposes. <br> <br>|||Changes to This Policy <br> <br> This Privacy Policy may be amended from time to time. Any such changes will be posted on this page. If we make a significant or material change in the way we use your personal information, the change will be posted on this page thirty (30) days prior to taking effect and registered users will be notified via email. <br> <br>
